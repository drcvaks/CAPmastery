# Testing Strategy

## Checkpoint gates

From Checkpoint 1 onward, every checkpoint runs the configured TypeScript check, lint, unit/component/integration tests, and an Expo startup/config validation. Database checkpoints also replay migrations and run SQL/RLS tests. Report the exact command, exit code, counts, and any skipped/non-applicable check.

## Planned tools

- TypeScript compiler in strict mode.
- ESLint with Expo/TypeScript support and a formatter decision at Checkpoint 1.
- Jest is the proposed runner because Expo/RN tooling uses it naturally; confirm current Expo guidance at Checkpoint 1.
- React Native Testing Library for components.
- Pure unit tests for algorithms and validators.
- Supabase CLI/local PostgreSQL tests for migrations, functions, and RLS when introduced.

## Coverage priorities

Unit: mastery, spaced dates, adaptive selection, readiness, practice blueprints, CSV validation, duplicate detection, role helpers.

Integration: session lifecycle, answer submission, linked-parent access, question approval, challenge lifecycle, and unauthorized content access.

RLS: Student A versus Student B, linked versus unrelated adult, reviewer versus private records, role escalation, draft/deactivated content, answer-key reads, and public-client calls to server-only operations.

Manual: Android sizes, responsive web admin, slow/offline transitions, background/resume, expired auth, duplicate taps, submission network loss, empty bank, missing citation, practice timeout, and partially completed challenge.

## Checkpoint 0 validation

No `package.json`, TypeScript source, Expo application, tests, migrations, or backend exists, so TypeScript, lint, unit tests, Expo startup, and RLS tests are not applicable. Checkpoint 0 instead validates documentation completeness, placeholder structure, secret scanning, Git separation, local tool versions, and mySCP unchanged state.
